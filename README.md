# Work-Assigner

This Project is written in Python, you can use fork and use this repository for assigning work to your teams without any conflict 
For Example, I had made this for my team when there were many slides and few people had to present the slides, so I feel this code is helpful for everyone any of the 
ways 

If it is helpful please message me on @coderiksenthil on Instagram regarding how you used it. 
Feel free to fork this project and help this project and you can do it in any language, just add multiple files and start coding and you can add multiple features also.

If you have any suggestions, please do give me on the same handle.

Thank You
